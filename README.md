# RayTracing Project

## Overview

This is a C++ project focusing on ray tracing, a technique for generating realistic computer-generated images by simulating the behavior of light rays. Ray tracing is widely used in computer graphics and animation to create visually stunning scenes and effects.


## About Ray Tracing

Ray tracing is a rendering technique that simulates the behavior of light rays as they interact with objects in a scene. It traces the path of light rays as they are emitted from a camera or light source and calculates how they bounce off surfaces, interact with materials, and reach the camera's sensor. This process allows for the creation of highly realistic images with accurate lighting, shadows, reflections, and refractions.

## Motivation

**Why Ray Tracing?**

Ray tracing is not just a powerful rendering technique; it's also a fascinating area of computer graphics and animation. It provides a deep understanding of how light and materials interact in the real world, allowing us to recreate these interactions in a virtual environment.

**Why This Project?**

This project aims to explore the world of ray tracing, diving into the intricacies of algorithms, optimizations, and physics simulations that make it possible. By building a ray tracer from scratch in C++, we gain hands-on experience and a deeper appreciation for the art and science of computer graphics.
